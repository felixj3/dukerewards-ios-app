Team lead and mentor: Philabian Lindo

Duke Rewards is an iOS app that seeks to increase student attendance and engagement at campus-wide events. Stakeholders include Duke Athletics and Duke Dining. Students attend events and verify their participation through our mobile app, using QR scanning and location tracking. An admin-only web app was built in conjunction for managerial purposes, allowing events, rewards, and other information to be created and displayed to students. 

If interested, check out the [demo video](https://youtu.be/hx9ewikBvFA) for the entire project (both iOS app and web app)
